# 4coder-customization-layer

modal keybinding customization layer for 4coder. Allows vim-like editing scheme, such as visual mode, insert mode, normal mode, and vim-like command prompt. However it's a heavily customized version towards my likings, so I only kept the functionalities that I use. 

Instruction:

Windows:
If you want to use my customization, just copy 4coder_custom_binding.cpp and build.bat into the same directory as 4coder, then call build.bat. Make sure you have vcvarsall variables in your shell when you call them. 

Other:
Just copy 4coder_custom_binding.cpp and compile that file as the source code for 4coder's dll.
